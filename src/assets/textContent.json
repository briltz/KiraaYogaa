    "intro2": "Yoga asana is an ancient spiritual practice that has been used for centuries to calm the energies in the body so that we can tune into our minds and hearts. Asana is the most commonly known part of yoga but it is only part of what it means to practice yoga. The truth is, yoga is an 8 limbed practice that we can use in every part of our lives. It is deeply important to me to honour and incorporate that history and the true intention through my teaching and personal practice.",
